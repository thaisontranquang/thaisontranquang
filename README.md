### Hello  ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I ?

I'm Thai-Son, a first year student in a digital school [MMI Bordeaux](https://www.mmibordeaux.com/) ! I'm learning web development, UI and UX design, and many other things. âœ¨

I now have a solid background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience with various web development frameworks and libraries such as React and Next.js which I'm still learning. ðŸ’»
