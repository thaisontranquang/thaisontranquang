### Hello  ðŸ‘‹

I'm Thai-Son, a first year student in a digital school [MMI Bordeaux](https://www.mmibordeaux.com/) ! I'm learning web development, UI, UX design, and many other things. âœ¨

Thanks to my bachelor, I now have a solid background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as experience with various web development frameworks and libraries such as React and Next.js which I'm still learning. ðŸ’»

I'm currently doing an internship as a front-end developer at [Kairos Agency](https://www.kairos-agency.com/) ! 

I'm looking for an apprenticeship as a web developer for the next two years ! You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tstranquang/) ðŸ’«
